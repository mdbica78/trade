# HANDOVER — live state of automated delivery
_Last updated: 2026-09-25 23:00 by PO (docs cleanup while both loops were stopped; no story in flight)_
Automation state: PAUSED — both loops stopped by the user for a docs cleanup; restart the autopilot to continue

Read this first, whatever agent you are (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot). Rules: AGENTS.md and `dev_minions/process.md` §5. Agents never run git — not even read-only; the user does.

## Exact next step
- Sprint 4 is closed (all four stories Awaiting QA, `SPRINT-04-audit.md` written, no story reopened). No `backlog/sprints/sprint-05.md` exists yet → deliver-story step 1b: `story-planner` "detail-sprint 5", then `tech-lead` "sprint-review 5". The planner must read `backlog/roadmap.md` → "Carry-forward notes" first.

## Waiting on the user
- Consolidated list (security, product decisions, acceptances, live checks, git): `status.md` → "Waiting on you". The PO keeps that list; add only **new** items below, one line each.
- Kit update (DEC-014, DEC-015): run `bash scripts/claude/install-kit.sh` before restarting the autopilot; start Codex with `automation/qa-goal.txt` right after.

## Log (newest first, one line each)
- 2026-09-25 — Technical Lead review of decisions, planning and code-review kit: DEC-014 (Codex QA loop runs only while the dev loop runs: `dev-loop.state` written by `autopilot.sh`, checked with `scripts/claude/dev-loop-status.sh`), DEC-015 (secrets beyond `.env*` + deny rules, disclose denied commands, verifiers cite only their own evidence, one verdict vocabulary, product questions ship isolated defaults, installer tidies backups and archived duplicates). Updated AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, roles/qa.md, roles/technical-lead.md, data-model.md, pending-kit; old DECs got amendment notes; `status.md` only in its Technical Lead section plus "Waiting on you" item 5. No code, story state, requirements or backlog touched.
- 2026-09-25 — PO docs cleanup: rewrote `status.md`, `process.md`, `README.md`, this file, `roles/`, `backlog/README.md`, `verification/README.md`; added `decisions/README.md` and roadmap carry-forward notes; old versions and the full per-story log moved to `_obsolete/`. No code touched.
- 2026-09-25 — Sprint 4 (US-016..019, monitoring UI) delivered; US-016 via the Copilot fallback. Audit: FINDINGS — C1 token printed into two local logs (user action), W1–W4 process/test notes; no story reopened.
- 2026-09-25 — Sprint 3 (US-012..015, cron + persistence) delivered. Audit reopened US-015 (AC4 test missing); fixed in round 2; US-015 accepted by the user after checking the Vercel cron logs.
- 2026-09-24 — DEC-013: QA and deploy-noticing moved to a separate Codex loop; this loop stops at Awaiting QA.
- 2026-09-24 — Sprint 2 (US-007..011, extraction core) delivered, audit PASS. `unpdf` pinned to 0.11.0 (1.8.1 breaks the flattened-text contract).
- 2026-09-23 — Sprint 1 (US-001..006, foundation) delivered, audit PASS; deployed to Vercel + Neon by the user.
- 2026-09-23 — Autopilot kit installed (DEC-009), made resilient to usage limits and network drops (DEC-011).
- Full per-story log before 2026-09-25 23:00: `_obsolete/HANDOVER-2026-09-25.md`.

## QA/Deploy log (Codex)
_Owned by the separate Codex QA/Deploy loop (DEC-013) — it appends here only, newest last, and
never edits anything above this line. The dev loop (Claude Code) never writes to this section.
Entries up to 2026-09-25 16:25 (US-008..US-018 QA PASS, pushes, `/health` check) are archived in
`_obsolete/HANDOVER-2026-09-25.md`; their results are on the `status.md` Story board._
- 2026-09-25 23:38 — dev loop not running (`WAITING-LIMIT`; resumes about 2026-09-26 01:31:30); QA loop stopped.
